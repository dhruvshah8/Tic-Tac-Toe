## About

Tic-tac-toe is a two player game that takes turn marking reservations on a 3 by 3 grid. The aim of this game is to get three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either player has three in a row or there is no room left.
